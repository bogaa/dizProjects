# dizProjects
 SNES and NES disassembly files of comercial games. 

  - This are work-in-progress or collected/improved disassembly files. (See credits for origen) 
  - Use diztinguish to open the diz files. In the export folders you will find more infos of the disassembled ROM. 
  - Distinguish will prompt to select the ROM if it can't find it. When the file is open you can export the disassembly.
  - The exported asm files can be assemble with ASAR https://github.com/RPGHacker/asar/releases/tag/v1.91
